  “It’s rewarding to see people develop confidence and control after a family breakdown.”

Vanessa Brown joined Hall Payne in 2008 with almost two decades experience as a principal lawyer in Brown & Baker lawyers in Ipswich. Her strong reputation in family law, succession law, and wills and estates has been built on her track record of resolving disputes at the earliest opportunity.

Vanessa says she enjoys seeing people’s perspective turnaround after they approach her for advice. “When people first come to me they can be wary and distrustful of the process,” she says. “It’s rewarding to see them develop confidence and regain control of their futures after a family breakdown.”

Vanessa wanted to be a lawyer ever since a high school guidance officer told her she’d be great for the job. She works with a diversity of people in need, helping them navigate the complexities of family law. “I act for the very young, the very old, people in same sex relationships, married and de facto couples, blended families, some families with complex financial and business interests and some without, as well as those dealing with debt or domestic violence.”

She has a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Queensland and is admitted to practice in The Supreme Court of Queensland and The High Court of Australia. She is a member of the Queensland Law Society and a past president of Ipswich District Law Association.

In her free time, Vanessa likes to work on creative tasks using her hands such as gardening, sewing and interior decorating. “I love travelling and experiencing different cultures and I do it as often as I can.”
